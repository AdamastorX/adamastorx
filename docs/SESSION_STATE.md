# Session state (agent handoff notes)

Working notes for picking up where the last Claude Code session left off.
Not a design doc, not an ADR — a scratch log of in-flight work, open
threads, and things the next session shouldn't have to re-discover the
hard way. Prune/rewrite freely as work completes; this file describes
*current* state, not history (git history is the record of the past).

Last updated: 2026-07-25.

## Where things stand

M2 Distributed Application: services#1 (gateway), services#2 (API),
services#3 (Kafka, ADR 0011), and services#4 (PostgreSQL, ADR 0012) are
done and closed. **observability#1 (OpenTelemetry tracing, ADR 0013,
backlog #17) is also done** — a real trace ID now correlates across
`gateway`→`api` (HTTP) and `api`→Kafka→`workers` (message hop),
confirmed in live application logs, not just "spans exist somewhere."
**services#5 (Redis) is the next open item** — see its issue body for
the measurable-hypothesis requirement before implementing (this session's
staff-eng review rewrote it; don't add Redis just because it's on the
approved stack).

M3's remaining items (#18 Prometheus/Grafana, #19 Loki/Tempo, #20
dashboards) can start in parallel with Redis — they don't gate on it,
see `docs/roadmap/milestones.md`.

## Recurring gotcha worth knowing before touching this stack again

**Boot 4.1 modularized its autoconfiguration**: the client library
(`spring-kafka`, `flyway-core`, classic Jackson 2, `opentelemetry-exporter-otlp`)
and the `FooAutoConfiguration` classes that actually wire it into a
Spring context live in *separate* artifacts (`spring-boot-kafka`,
`spring-boot-flyway`, `spring-boot-micrometer-tracing` +
`-opentelemetry`). Adding the client library alone compiles fine and
then silently doesn't work at runtime — no error, the feature just
never activates. Hit this four separate times now (services#3, #4,
observability#1). If a future integration (Redis, anything else)
compiles clean but a Boot feature just isn't activating, check for a
matching `spring-boot-<name>` artifact before assuming the library
itself is broken.

**Boot property names move between major versions without a compile
error.** `management.otlp.tracing.endpoint` looked right (matches the
Boot 3.x docs pattern still floating around) but is deprecated at error
level since Boot 4.0 and silently binds to nothing — no startup
failure, no export failure, just a property nobody reads. Correct path:
`management.opentelemetry.tracing.export.otlp.endpoint`. When a
property "should" work and doesn't, check the actual
`spring-configuration-metadata.json` inside the relevant
`spring-boot-*` jar (`unzip -p <jar> META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json`)
before assuming the code is broken — it's often the property name that
moved.

**`OTEL_*`-prefixed environment variables are reserved by the
OpenTelemetry SDK itself**, independent of whatever Spring property
you meant them to override. Naming a Kubernetes Deployment env var
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (seemed like the "correct, standard"
choice) made the OTel SDK's own `autoconfigure-spi` module pick it up
directly and build a second, conflicting exporter, doubling the
`/v1/traces` path into a silent 404. Any future OTel-adjacent
deploy-time override needs a name outside the `OTEL_*` namespace.

**Hand-built Spring beans bypass Boot's `*.observation-enabled`
properties.** `WorkItemProducerConfig`/`WorkItemConsumerConfig`
construct their own typed `KafkaTemplate`/listener container factory
(documented reason: Boot's auto-configured ones are untyped) —
`spring.kafka.template.observation-enabled`/`.listener.observation-enabled`
only wire into Boot's *own* auto-configured beans, so those properties
were silent no-ops here. Needed an explicit
`.setObservationEnabled(true)` call in the `@Bean` methods themselves.
Same likely applies to any other hand-built Spring integration bean
going forward — check whether a "just set this property" fix is
actually reaching the bean in use.

## Cluster access (this machine)

k3s kubeconfig at `~/.kube/config`. `kubectl` here does **not** default
to it on its own — always run with `KUBECONFIG` set explicitly:
```
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
```
Not persisted in `~/.bashrc` (blocked by the permission classifier) —
set it per session.

## ArgoCD stuck-operation gremlin (if it recurs)

An `Application`'s `.operation` field (the in-flight sync request) can
get stuck holding a **stale** values snapshot from an earlier commit and
keep re-applying it on retry, ignoring that `.spec.source` has since
changed. Refresh annotations and restarting `argocd-repo-server`/
`argocd-application-controller` don't clear this. What works:
```
kubectl patch application <name> -n argocd --type merge -p '{"operation":null}'
```
Check `kubectl get application <name> -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.operation}'`
before assuming a "keeps reapplying the wrong thing" symptom is a
caching/chart problem — it might just be a frozen operation.

## Namespace-per-component isn't absolute

Established pattern: each service/infra component gets its own
namespace (gateway, api, workers, kafka, otel). PostgreSQL broke that
pattern deliberately (ADR 0012) — it lives in `api`'s namespace, not
its own, because `secretKeyRef` can't cross namespaces and Postgres has
exactly one consumer here. The OTel Collector (ADR 0013) got its own
`otel` namespace like Kafka, not Postgres's treatment — three consumers,
no credential to worry about (open OTLP receiver, like Kafka's
PLAINTEXT). If Redis ends up needing credentials and has a single
consumer, the Postgres reasoning likely applies again — don't assume a
new namespace by default.

## Where to look next

- services#5 (Redis) is next — write/confirm the measurable hypothesis
  in its issue body before touching code (this session's staff-eng
  review already rewrote the issue for this reason).
- M3 items #18-20 can run in parallel with Redis — same shape of
  decisions likely needed as Kafka/Postgres/OTel: client library choice,
  deployment pattern (probably the same Helm-chart-via-ArgoCD-Application
  pattern every stateful/infra piece has used so far), a namespace call
  using the reasoning above.
